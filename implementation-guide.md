- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations synced to the sheet
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity between app and sheet

## How to Use the Enhanced System

### Step 1: Setup
1. Save all three updated files (`updated-index.html`, `updated-app.js`, `updated-style.css`)
2. Rename them to `index.html`, `app.js`, and `style.css` respectively
3. Upload to your web server or open locally

### Step 2: Using Bulk Import
1. Navigate to Team Management section
2. Click "AI Bulk Import" button
3. Select file format (CSV, Excel, JSON, or Text)
4. Upload your file via drag-and-drop or file picker
5. Watch as Groq AI analyzes and extracts the data
6. Review the detected fields and data preview
7. Click "Import Data" to add team members

### Step 3: File Format Requirements
The AI is smart enough to handle various formats, but for best results:

**CSV/Text Files:**
```csv
Name,Email,Department,Role,Skills,Experience Level,Phone,Specialization
John Doe,john@company.com,Engineering,Developer,"React,Node.js",Senior,+1-555-0123,Full-Stack
```

**Excel Files:**
- Use standard column headers
- First row should contain field names
- Data should be in subsequent rows

**JSON Files:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@company.com",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "role": "Developer",
    "skills": ["React", "Node.js"],
    "experienceLevel": "Senior"
  }
]
```

2. **Enable Google Sheets API**
3. **Create Service Account**
4. **Share your sheet with service account email**
5. **Update the `updateGoogleSheet()` function with real API calls**

### Environment Variables
```javascript
const GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const SPREADSHEET_ID = '1p4BpUlDzCihngl2wIP8LZJakGLylsRPQ2u0-kTa85sk';
```
